    "In this question, we are asked to write a Python script that finds the root of the equation `e^x = 10 â€“ 2x` accurate to 6 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use the bisection method. First, we define a function `f(x) = e^x - 10 + 2x`. We then choose two initial points `xa = 1` and `xb = 3` such that `f(xa)` and `f(xb)` have opposite signs. This means that there is at least one root in the interval `(1, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute the midpoint `xm` of `xa` and `xb`, and evaluate `f(xm)`. We then choose two points out of the three points `xa`, `xb`, and `xm` where `f` has opposite signs, but one of those points must be `xm`. We replace one of `xa` or `xb` with `xm` based on the signs above, and repeat the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first make a loop that runs 10 times to test our program, and then re-write the program so that it stops when the desired accuracy is obtained."

We then use the method of bisection to find the value of `t` that gives us the intersection point accurate to 5 decimal places.
